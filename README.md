## Inspiration

Vancouver is prone to a number of natural disasters, such as Wildfires, Earthquakes and Hailstorms. We wanted to build an alexa skill that allows families around the world to quiz themselves on safety procedures on a daily basis. 

## What it does

**UBCcure** is an Alexa skill, a "Safety Trivia" that allows users to interact with Alexa, answering questions randomized from a collection of different questions safety and gain points upon getting the right answer. 

## How we built it

We built UBCcure with javascript, on Amazon's very own _ AWS _developer console and _ Lambda _. We implemented Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Node.js. We have tested on Amazon's Echo 2. 

## Challenges we ran into

Fixing unexpected errors that arose in the middle of the night. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Learning how to use and integrate AWS and Lambda in one day. It was our first Hackathon for most of us, and we had a lot of fun working with new technology. 

## What we learned

We learned that we can do anything, especially when we put our minds into it. Nothing is impossible!!!

## What's next for UBCcure
We are planning on making the code open-source with detailed instructions so that anyone around the world can easily access the code and make changes that best fit their needs.
